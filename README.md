# Interview Exercises

This repo contains some projects that could be used for interviewing frontend engineers.

## Shopping Cart
This is an example provided in by Redux to show how to integrate with React. It is a barebones shopping cart that pulls products from a json file. Possible enhancement tasks could be:
* Make calls to a product API
* Calculate total with sales tax in mind (would require adding State input and hooking up to api)
* Add unit tests
* Search products
* Filter products
* Remove from cart per item

## Fetch Suburbs
This is a simple React application that makes queries to an endpoint for Suburbs. It searches as you type. Possible enhancements include:
* Retrieve the weather for the selected suburb
* Implement routing to take and display suburb details on separate page

## React Todos
Simple todo list app using React and Redux. Also from the Redux repo examples.
* Edit Todo
* Add date to todo
* Allow reordering of todos
* Sort todos by date
* Add categories
